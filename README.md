# Tyrannosaurus - Brute Force Tool

## Description

This Python script is designed to perform brute force attacks by repeatedly trying different input values (such as words or passwords) until the correct one is found. Brute force is a common method used in cybersecurity to crack passwords, encryption keys, or access controls.

The script takes a list of words as input (either from a custom file or a predefined list) and sends each word to a specified destination. It can be used for various purposes, such as testing the security of a system, recovering lost passwords, or automating repetitive tasks that involve trying multiple inputs.

## Implementation

The script is written in Python and utilizes the `keyboard` library to simulate typing the words. It also incorporates logging functionality to track the actions taken during the brute force process.

The main functionalities of the script include:
- Reading words from a custom word file or a predefined list
- Sending each word to a specified destination
- Pausing and resuming the brute force process
- Logging each action for debugging and tracking purposes
